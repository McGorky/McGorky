Hi, Iâ€™m @McGorky,

I'd like to think I'm a jack of all trades but it might just be I'm a master of none.

Evergrowing list of my interests right now consists of:
- All things embedded
- Rust
- Functional programming (primarily F#, but also functional paradigm in general)
- Android in conjunction with Kotlin
- Modern C++
- ROS
- Unity + C#
- Game developement in general

If you are interested in contacting me for whatever reason - just open an issue on related repository

Good luck and have fun
